# Robotic Arm Simulation with TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates a 2D robotic arm simulation that uses both analytical inverse kinematics and machine learning to control arm positioning. The simulation allows users to click on a point, and the robotic arm will move to reach that target using either mathematical formulas or a trained neural network.
